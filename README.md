## Auren Auto-Gold

This repository is part of the **Auren ecosystem**, an early-stage research and applied
initiative focused on computational systems, automation, and AI-driven orchestration.

The project explores agent-based architectures, memory systems, and automated pipelines
for scalable content and system workflows.

This repository currently serves as a public technical reference while the
Auren Research Group structure is being formalized.
